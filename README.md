## Notes

We are using axios to get the data. I chose not to use redux and sagas just because I do not get any exposure to them on Tide so I just went with what I know for now which is hooks.

All testing is done by using testIds for the ui. This is a pattern that we came up with in Tide and I beleive it is much more safe than looking for component types.
